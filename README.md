# Simple CRM Web Application

(WIP: App currently in development)

Simple, modern CRM (Customer Relationship Management) full stack web app. Built with React/JavaScript/Apollo/TailwindCSS on frontend and using Node/Express/GraphQL/MongoDB for the backend. Demo app for tracking sales prospecting accounts, prospects, and interactions.

## Project Description

Sales prospecting web application with different routes and pages for sales professionals to track their accounts, prospects, and interactions in a seamless and modern UI/UX.

#### Areas of Focus
- Creating backend first with Node/Express/GraphQL/MongoDB/Mongoose
- React.js for single page application creating reusable components
- React Router DOM for easy to use routing/navigation
- Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with GraphQL and Apollo Client
- Styling with TailwindCSS utility classes

#### Challenges
After completing a smaller project management application to learn GraphQL and Apollo I decided to build this to take my learning a step further. Good challenge to learn a new technology.

## Flow of Application / How to Navigate

1. User loads the page and taken to main dashboard page to get an overview of the account based prospecting data
2. The user can navigate between pages with a side navigation to access accounts, prospects, and interactions
3. Each page displays data with React Data Grid library for an easy to use experience
4. onClick events for each row to display additional information and make necessary changes (CRUD operations)

## Background

#### Why I Built This
With my background in software sales, I have used many different CRM and sales prospecting software throughout my early career. While learning GraphQL and Apollo to create full stack web applications I completed a project management app and the idea for a CRM app came to me as a logical place to further my learning in a larger project.

#### WIP / Next Steps
I am currently still building this app and will be making more commits in the coming days to improve the functionality and refactor for cleaner code. I also see opportunities for more reusable components (especially layout components) that I will implement to avoid repetition. The dashboard is a work in progress that I am working on the design for now as well as what data would be important to show.

## How to Run

Backend in main directory - 'npm run dev' - to spin up Node server
Frontend - cd into the client directory - 'npm start' - to spin up React client
